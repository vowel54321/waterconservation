<h3>Below are some of the many ways that we can implement as an individual or as a household to save water</h3>
<h4>1. Turn off the taps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a tap running while brushing teeth uses 6 litres of water a minute. And by fixing a dripping tap you can save over 60 litres of water a week.
</ul>

<h4>2. Boil what you need</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only boil as many cups of water as you need for your tea round – you’ll be saving money and energy.
</ul>

<h4>3. Shower with less</h4>
<ul>
<li>It’s easy to linger in the shower when you’re sleepy in the morning – four-minute timers can help. And switching to an efficient shower head will allow you to lather up in less water.
</ul>

<h4>7. Catch rainwater</h4>
<ul>
<li>Installing water butts saves you turning on the tap. And your plants will thank you for rainwater rather than treated tap water. You can also cut water use by 33% by watering plants manually instead of using automatic sprinklers.
