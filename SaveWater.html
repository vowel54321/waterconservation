<li>Saving water saves lives. Since water is essential for life itself, we need to conserve it for the future generation. Nowadays, we use and misused water more than we need. Everyone must know that it is our primary duty to learn its importance and how easy it would be to take action now before it’s too late.
 
 
 
    <li>Conservation is defined as “the act of preserving, guarding and protecting or wise use of environment or its natural resources.” It can be done or start even on the small number of adjustments that could become a big blast in conserving more water now and for future use.

 <li>It can simply start with you or in your own home. It is now time to make those simple plans for saving water every day. Sometimes we don’t care how much water we waste in doing our daily chores. There are those simple ways in which we take water for granted. For instance, when brushing teeth or washing hands, we use to let tap water flow instead of turning it off to reduce waste.
<li>It is a matter of mind over matter. We only need to remember always how precious water is every time we use it, like taking a bath, washing clothes, flushing the toilet, or even just watering plants to conserve and protect it easily.
 <li> Water recycling could be best done too! You can cut down your water usage through proper recycling in your home. You can start up from your kitchen, wherein you can save those leftover drinking water from being used for other possible purposes.
